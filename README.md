# Operating System (RTOS) Project 

Welcome to my  Operating System  project repository! This repository showcases my implementation of system calls and libc functions tailored for a real-world application in an educational setting. Designed to deepen students' understanding of operating systems, this project encompasses essential components developed from scratch within the context of the egos-2000 teaching operating system.

## Project Highlights

- **Innovative System Calls**: Implemented a new `setprio` system call to manage process priorities effectively, enriching the system's functionality.
  
- **Process Management**: Developed process control blocks to meticulously track crucial process attributes such as priority, creation time, and context switches.
  
- **Enhanced Process Control**: Introduced a `kill` system call and corresponding application to facilitate graceful process termination by PID, enhancing system stability and management.
  
- **Improved Monitoring**: Enhanced the `ps` command to provide comprehensive insights into process details, aiding in system monitoring and analysis.

## Contributions and Feedback

This project was spearheaded by [John Doe](https://github.com/john_doe) as part of a systems class. I welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions for further enhancements. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to enrich this repository further!

## Vision and Impact

This project aspires to democratize access to operating system knowledge, making it accessible and comprehensible to every college student. With the lightweight and educational egos-2000 operating system, students can explore the intricacies of OS design and implementation firsthand. By fostering a deeper understanding of OS principles, this project aims to empower future generations of developers and engineers.
